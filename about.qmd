I am a PhD student at Ghent University in the [H-CEL research group](https://www.ugent.be/bw/environment/en/research/h-cel), under supervision of Prof. Niko Verhoest and Prof. Diego Miralles. [My current research](https://github.com/olivierbonte/DifferentiableEvaporation) focusses on hybrid modelling of land surface processes, specifically evaporation, where machine learning techniques are combined with process based models. 

More generally, I am interested in:

- Hydrology and water resources engineering
- Scientific computing and its application in environmental sciences
- Open source software development and reproducible research, specifically using [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and Python
